Question:
Write a program to create a basic calculator for addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division. The program should ask for two numbers
(floating point) and perform all the operations.

I/P => number1, number2
O/P => The addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division value
       of 2 numbers ___ and ___ is ___, ___, ___, and ___
